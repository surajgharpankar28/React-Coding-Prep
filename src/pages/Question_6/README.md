**Day 6 React Interview Coding Question (Revised)**  
**Problem Statement:**  
Create a **Multi-Step Form Wizard** that:  
1. Guides users through 3 steps:  
   - Step 1: Personal Details (Name, Email)  
   - Step 2: Address Information (Street, City, ZIP Code)  
   - Step 3: Confirmation & Summary  
2. Features:  
   - Progress indicator showing current step  
   - Validation for each step (e.g., valid email format, ZIP code length)  
   - "Back" and "Next" navigation buttons  
   - Final submission with success/error feedback  
   - Persist form data if the user refreshes the page  
3. Technical Requirements:  
   - Use React Context API or Redux for state management  
   - Implement responsive design  
   - Add loading animation during mock API submission

### **What to Submit:**  
Your React component code (including form logic and styling).  

---

### **Evaluation Criteria**  
1. State management across multiple steps  
2. Validation logic implementation  
3. UI/UX (progress indicator, error messages)  
4. Code organization and reusability  
5. Data persistence in localStorage  

---

**Example Flow:**  
1. User fills personal details â†’ validates email â†’ proceeds  
2. User enters address â†’ validates ZIP code â†’ proceeds  
3. User reviews data â†’ submits â†’ sees success message  

Would you like me to provide a solution template or clarification on any requirements? ðŸ˜Š
