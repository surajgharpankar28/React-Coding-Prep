# React Interview Coding Preparation Approach

## 📖 Overview
A daily coding practice system where:
1. **You act as the interviewee** solving React-focused problems.
2. **Deepseek (AI) acts as the interviewer**, providing questions and detailed feedback on your solutions.

---
## Create Own AI Coding Preparation System
Enter the prompt into **ChatGPT**, **Deepseek** or any other LLM of your choice.
```
Act as a "React" interviewer.
You will provide me with interview coding questions daily, specifically designed for React Frontend Developer roles with 2-4 years of experience.

Once you provide the question, I’ll try to solve it and share my solution with you. You will then analyze it to see if I have solved it correctly or if any changes are needed.

I will ask you daily for a new question.
For example: "Hey Deepseek, it’s Day 1 of React Interview Coding Question"
Then, you will provide me with a new question.
```

## 🔄 Daily Process
Follow this cycle for each day of practice:

### 1. **Request a Question**
   - **Prompt**: Start with `"Hey Deepseek, it's Day [X] of React Interview Coding Question"`.
   - **Outcome**: Receive a React coding question aligned with industry expectations for 2-4YOE roles.

### 2. **Solve the Problem**
   - Write code for the given question (15-45 mins).
   - Focus on:
     - React best practices
     - Component structure
     - State management
     - Performance optimizations
     - Edge cases

### 3. **Submit Your Solution**
   - Share your code and a brief explanation of your approach.

### 4. **Receive Feedback**
   - Deepseek will analyze your solution for:
     - Correctness
     - Code quality
     - Potential improvements
     - Alternative approaches
   - Example feedback format:
     ```markdown
     ### Analysis
     - **Correctness**: [✅/❌]
     - **Strengths**: List of well-implemented aspects
     - **Improvements**: Suggestions for optimization/best practices
     - **Alternate Approaches**: Other valid solutions
     ```

### 5. **Repeat Daily**
   - New question each day with progressive complexity.

## 🧩 Example Workflow
**User Prompt**:  
`"Hey Deepseek, it's Day 1 of React Interview Coding Question"`

**Sample Question**:  
`"Create a controlled form component with validation for email and password fields. Show real-time error messages."`

**Sample Submission**:  
```jsx
// Your solution code here
```

**Sample Feedback**:  
```markdown
### Analysis
- **Correctness**: ✅
- **Strengths**: 
  - Proper use of controlled components
  - Clean validation logic
- **Improvements**:
  - Consider using `useReducer` for complex state
  - Add accessibility attributes to error messages
```

## 🎯 Key React Areas Covered
- Component design (Class vs Functional)
- Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc.)
- State management (Local/Context/Redux)
- Performance (Memoization, virtualization)
- Error boundaries
- Testing strategies
- Common patterns (Compound components, Render Props)

---

## 📚 Prerequisites
- Foundational React knowledge
- Familiarity with ES6+ JavaScript
- Basic understanding of HTML/CSS
- Experience with build tools (Webpack, Babel)

---

## 💡 How to Use This Effectively
1. **Be Consistent**: Daily practice > cramming.
2. **Simulate Real Interviews**: Time yourself strictly.
3. **Learn from Feedback**: Implement suggestions in subsequent days.
4. **Build a Repository**: Keep all solutions for later review.
